Find a bug in Gmail

**Steps to reproduce**

- Create filter with this search to: example@noreply.github.com 
 
- Choose Skip Inbox, Mark as read and Never send it to spam 
 
- Done 

When you get an email from example@noreply.github.com, the email will be marked as read, and not sent to spam, but it still in the Inbox, not archived.
