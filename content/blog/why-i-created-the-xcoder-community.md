You know, it's been almost 7 years since I registered the domain name xcoder.org in 2016. I never knew what kind of product to make with this domain name until recently.

Twitter represents one of the shining gems of the Web 2.0 epoch, a platform I find myself engaging with on a near-daily basis. The compelling allure of Twitter resides in its ability to let global narratives flow unfettered, serving as a window to the pulse of the world. It dismantles traditional barriers to information, facilitating efficient information exchange in a way that's both refreshing and powerful. Truly, the experience it offers is nothing short of extraordinary.

But now, everything has changed since Musk's acquisition. It's not the same Twitter that I once loved so much. The most significant thing I've ever said about Twitter.

Mastodon is a good app, but it's not a replacement for Twitter. Mastodon is more for a group of people than for everyone on the planet. It takes a lot of effort to discover what's in it than twitter. It really can't make information flow as quickly and widely as twitter does.

So, why can't I create a Mastodon node? This node serves the digital nomads working from the planet. They are developers, designers, creators, etc. 

That's [xcoder.org](https://xcoder.org/@about)

I've temporarily built this community with gotosocial, another kind of mastodon. If interested, feel free to visit xcoder.org and join in.

updated@20231125, I apologize for closing this community. There are many such communities available now. Instead, I will develop a client for such communities.

update@20231221, I reopen this community several days ago because I can't change the data generated under this domain name to another domain name to continue using it. BTW, it seems Twitter is experiencing another downtime.
